  abstract = {This paper presents an original probabilistic method for the
              numerical computations of Greeks (i.e. price sensitivities) in
              finance. Our approach is based on the integration-by-parts formula,
              which lies at the core of the theory of variational stochastic
              calculus, as developed in the Malliavin calculus. The Greeks
              formulae, both with respect to initial conditions and for smooth
              perturbations of the local volatility, are provided for general
              discontinuous path-dependent payoff functionals of multidimensional
              diffusion processes. We illustrate the results by applying the
              formula to exotic European options in the framework of the Black
              and Scholes model. Our method is compared to the Monte Carlo finite
              difference approach and turns out to be very efficient in the case
              of discontinuous payoff functionals.},
